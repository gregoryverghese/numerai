<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Numerai Tournament is a stock market prediction challenge. The aim is to use machine learning techniques on abstract financial data to predict the stock market. Saturday of each week new data is released and predictions are submitted on the following Monday. We can stake our models with the NMR cryptocurrency to earn rewards based on performance.

Models and scripts are stored in this repository are my submissions to the weekly challenge. Scripts and jupyter notebook indexed by week and round.
